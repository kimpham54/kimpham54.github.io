kimpham54.github.io is dead. Long live kimpham54.github.io!

A fresh new look as of August 2022. Using the more frequently updated Archie theme (https://github.com/athul/archie), wanted to keep it simple without netlify, want to use Github Actions to build and load rather than have two repositories for deployment. Migrated all my content over.

untracked content with archie theme git submodule rm craziness
oops forgot https
