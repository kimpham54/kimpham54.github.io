Used in production at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, an app that scrapes (with author permission) and aggregates oral histories in the field of biomedicine, used for historical research. I hired and consulted on the architecture and design on app and work on some parts of the front-end. The frontend uses VueJS set up with MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
The code is available in a private repository in Gitlab for the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science.</description></item><item><title>Software project: Climbing logbook</title><link>https://kimpham54.github.io/cv/app-climbing-logbook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kimpham54.github.io/cv/app-climbing-logbook/</guid><description>Last updated: October 31, 2022

An experimental React app that I worked on as part of the Flatiron School bootcamp. The focus was on creating complex data routes with Redux and hierarchical data organization. You can create climbs, and within those climbs you can create routes, and tally your routes up per climb.
