			<p>former title: flatiron school portfolio project 004 + church wafer javascript</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been working on my fourth portfolio project for flatiron while doing a west coast tour of the United States. inspired by my friends, ardent lovers of good food made with care and consideration, i decided to make my application about <a href="https://github.com/kimpham54/js_portfolio_project_recipes">recipes</a>. i find that the flatiron school has a solid, tight curriculum - everything i&rsquo;ve learned in the program so far has built upon each other.</p>
<p>in a specific programming language (Ruby) you start by learning about basic programming (basic operators, syntax, loops), then learn about object-oriented programming, then you learn about HTML, CSS, SQL, then you learn a lightweight Ruby framework (Sinatra), then a more powerful Ruby framework (Rails), then using Ruby and Rails with vanilla (meaning basic, or church wafer) Javascript, and finally we&rsquo;ll learn to use a powerful Javascript framework (React). I appreciate that we get to learn and spend a considerable amount of time working with the basic languages before getting into the higher-level, abstracted frameworks so we can understand how for instance Rails or React functions and libraries are operating at a deeper level.</p>
<p>our project requires us to develop a Rails API application, which Rails handily allows you to do by providing an API flag. so instead of
<code>rails new my_app</code>
you also add the api flag,
<code>rails new my_app --api</code></p>
<p>and this will do <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html">three things</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove some middleware related to browser functionality</li>
<li>ApplicationController inherts from ActionCtronller::API instead of ActionController::Base</li>
<li>if you use rails generator (e.g. <code>rails g resource</code> or <code>resources g controller model</code>) it will skip the creation of views, helpers, other browser assets</li>
</ol>
<p>You might want to use Rails as an API application in order to build out a back-end, and then you can use another language or framework for your frontend. In our case, we are using Javascript, a language originally designed for the front-end and is very popular and mature enough to have many additional front-end features that Rails alone cannot compete with. API functionality is what ties everything together - Rails communicates with Javascript by sending data (resources) in a lightweight, interoperable format.</p>
<p>Learning about Ruby has primed me to learn about Javascript, in particular object oriented Javascript. There&rsquo;s still a bit of additional complexity that we&rsquo;re learning with Javascript that I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around, such as scope, and web technology concepts I&rsquo;m familiarizing myself with such as asynchronous events (fetch() and AJAX), targets, and DOM terminologies.</p>
