kimpham54.github.io is dead. Long live kimpham54.github.io!

A fresh new look as of August 2022. Using the more frequently updated Archie theme (https://github.com/athul/archie), wanted to keep it simple without netlify, want to use Github Actions to build and load rather than have two repositories for deployment. Migrated all my content over.

- deploy workflow is in .github
- all config parameters are in config.toml
- override css in assets, override layouts in layouts

2022-08-17
- unpublish site and republish github actions
- branches still called master not main
- untracked content with archie theme git submodule rm craziness
- oops forgot https https://github.com/athul/archie/issues/1
