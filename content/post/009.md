i just came back from a hut and climbing trip in west switzerland. i have a six year relationship with climbing, and we're pretty comfortable with each other, but in many ways we are still figuring things out. it's hard to overcome my fear of a bad fall, but i do love the challenge of managing that fear. i take it easy, i'm not in a rush to be the best. it's something i want to do for a long time. it was partially my decision and knowing what i want out of climbing, and partially coming to terms with the limits of myself and the time i want to devote to climbing vs other things i care about. and i am satisfied.
