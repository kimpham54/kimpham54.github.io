i&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to learn systems programming&amp;hellip;i wanted to be exposed to deeper programming concepts. i do appreciate web development and working on web and business logic on the front and backend, but i&amp;rsquo;m also interested in coding that&amp;rsquo;s closer to computer science, or at least working with the ideas of computer science. and to better understand things at a lower level.</description></item><item><title>ontology coordination with sparql</title><link>https://kimpham54.github.io/post/011/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kimpham54.github.io/post/011/</guid><description>isn&amp;rsquo;t it beautiful? it&amp;rsquo;s web3.0!

the setup is simple, you (my non-existent reader) can use the colab notebook i pasted below, or to install it on your local, you can follow my already going to be outdated in october 2022 steps that i followed from @levelsio who followed that from someone else:</description></item></channel></rss>
