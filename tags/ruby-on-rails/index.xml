and&amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap. what a year and a bit it&amp;rsquo;s been. finally, i accomplished something that i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about doing for a long time (about 2 years?), jumped in, managing that with a full time job, life in a new country, precious life things outside of work. i had a hard time juggling everything, but i feel good about finishing the program.</description></item><item><title>ruby + rails + church wafer javascript project 004 - communal recipes</title><link>https://kimpham54.github.io/post/005/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kimpham54.github.io/post/005/</guid><description>former title: flatiron school portfolio project 004 + church wafer javascript
