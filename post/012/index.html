I do miss being part of that libraryland world - much love to Islandora.</p><p>truer to my interests and desire to work more with maps, i reached out to max who&rsquo;s working on maplibre-rs. i&rsquo;ve lurked in the community for a bit, but let him know i was interested in a beginner task. so finally when one came up i volunteered.</p><p>i was working on parsing some style specs over the christmas break. took a break, then came back to it in february, which means i forgot everything. henceforth i shall keep notes, and you&rsquo;re welcome to peruse them too.</p><h3 id=maplibre-rs-style-parser>maplibre-rs style parser</h3><p>maplibre-rs has the original maplibre as a module which contains styles. here we&rsquo;re trying to parse an input style in json and deserialize it into a rust object.</p><ul><li><p>serialize
