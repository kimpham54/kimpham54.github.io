I appreciate that we get to learn and spend a considerable amount of time working with the basic languages before getting into the higher-level, abstracted frameworks so we can understand how for instance Rails or React functions and libraries are operating at a deeper level.</p><p>our project requires us to develop a Rails API application, which Rails handily allows you to do by providing an API flag. so instead of
<code>rails new my_app</code>
you also add the api flag,
<code>rails new my_app --api</code></p><p>and this will do <a href=https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html>three things</a>:</p><ol><li>remove some middleware related to browser functionality</li><li>ApplicationController inherts from ActionCtronller::API instead of ActionController::Base</li><li>if you use rails generator (e.g. <code>rails g resource</code> or <code>resources g controller model</code>) it will skip the creation of views, helpers, other browser assets</li></ol><p>You might want to use Rails as an API application in order to build out a back-end, and then you can use another language or framework for your frontend. In our case, we are using Javascript, a language originally designed for the front-end and is very popular and mature enough to have many additional front-end features that Rails alone cannot compete with. API functionality is what ties everything together - Rails communicates with Javascript by sending data (resources) in a lightweight, interoperable format.</p><p>Learning about Ruby has primed me to learn about Javascript, in particular object oriented Javascript. There&rsquo;s still a bit of additional complexity that we&rsquo;re learning with Javascript that I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around, such as scope, and web technology concepts I&rsquo;m familiarizing myself with such as asynchronous events (fetch() and AJAX), targets, and DOM terminologies.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/ruby>ruby</a></li><li><a href=/tags/ruby-on-rails>ruby on rails</a></li><li><a href=/tags/javascript>javascript</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></article></main><footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/feather-icons/dist/feather.min.js></script><div>This site is under the <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a> license.
