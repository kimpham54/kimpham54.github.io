      <description>&lt;p&gt;on a sunday, some sundays ago, i took my quiet night as a cue to nerd up, so i downloaded stable diffusion and played around with it. i read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jonstokes.com/p/ai-content-generation-part-1-machine&#34;&gt;a beautifully written piece about machine learning by jon stokes&lt;/a&gt;, setting aside any political views, which was deeply moving and really made me want to play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the setup is simple, you (my non-existent reader) can use the colab notebook i pasted below, or to install it on your local, you can follow my already going to be outdated in october 2022 steps that i followed from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/levelsio&#34;&gt;@levelsio&lt;/a&gt; who followed that from someone else:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
