&lt;p&gt;the setup is simple, you (my non-existent reader) can use the colab notebook i pasted below, or to install it on your local, you can follow my already going to be outdated in october 2022 steps that i followed from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio"&gt;@levelsio&lt;/a&gt; who followed that from someone else:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
