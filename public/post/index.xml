      <title>JPEG2000 byte modifications with Python and Docker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year I worked on a Python project for Harvard University: the library system runs a mega digital repository, and a subset of JPEG 2000 images had a very particular kind of ICC profile corruption detected by Kakadu but not by jpylyzer, two validation tools they use.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I wrote &lt;strong&gt;jp2_remediator&lt;/strong&gt; to validate and (when safe) repair those files so downstream systems could read them. I made a command-line app in a Docker image that scans a single file, a directory, or an S3 bucket.&#xA;When it&amp;rsquo;s put in production, Apache Airflow pulls this image and runs the CLI inside the container for each image, giving us reproducible runs across environments and easy horizontal scaling.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The specs I used and actually really enjoyed studying were:&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;jp2 remediator&#xA;JCRS csv importer&#xA;At the beginning of the year I worked on a Python project for Harvard University, the library system has a mega digital repository, with some corrupted JPEG2000 images.&#xA;At the time of this writing and hopefully for ever and ever, all tests pass with 100% coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/2025-11-07-jp2tests.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jp2_remediator tests&#34; title=&#34;jp2_remediator tests&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The module is a command line service, it reads the bytes of a jp2 file or directory of files or an input S3 bucket, then&#xA;looks for presence of an &amp;lsquo;ICC profile&amp;rsquo; in the jp2 bytestream,&#xA;maps and validates curv values according to the ISO/IEC 15444-1:2019 (E) and ICC.1:2022 Specifications&#xA;corrects values where the rTRC/gTRC/bTRC tag size in the Tag table structure (ICC.1:2022 Table 24 tag size) is not the same as the count value (gamma, where n == 1) in the curveType encoding (ICC.1:2022 Table 35, n value)&#xA;flag and (optionally) log values where the count value n != 1 for future review&#xA;later used in apache airflow workflow for all images in the repository&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the pretty poster for my first web map, made for the Scarborough Historical Society and started out as a project for Marcel Fortin at the University of Toronto iSchool which was then moved to the Map and Data Library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ola-poster-information-use--reuse-community-collaboration-with-open-source-web-mapping&#34;&gt;OLA Poster: Information Use &amp;amp; Reuse: Community Collaboration with Open Source Web Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open-source technologies are creating new avenues for community engagement. Web developer tools are empowering librarians and users alike.  This project utilizes open-source GIS and JavaScript libraries to visualize data from the Scarborough Historical Society photo collection in an interactive app.  Ongoing developments will invite users to contribute their own stories, comments, and pictures that build community history.  The success of this project led to its adoption as a teaching and literacy tool in the Scarborough Archives.

      <title>a hugo and archie upgrade</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/0013/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I upgraded both Hugo and the Archie (it&amp;rsquo;s still being updated!) theme for this site. It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years since the last update, so this was a chance to tidy things up and modernize the structure. The first step was simply updating the theme submodule:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init --remote --merge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I cleared out old build artifacts so Hugo could rebuild everything cleanly. Some helpful warnings when I tried to compile hugo lead to fixing syntax on how to locate templates, conditionals, modifying some partials. Archie now compiles its own stylesheet, so my older first.css needed to be reorganized into a slimmer override layer. Social icons also changed, so I incorporated the updated Feather icon approach used by the theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;on a sunday, some sundays ago, i took my quiet night as a cue to nerd up, so i downloaded stable diffusion and played around with it. i read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jonstokes.com/p/ai-content-generation-part-1-machine&#34;&gt;a beautifully written piece about machine learning by jon stokes&lt;/a&gt;, setting aside any political views, which was deeply moving and really made me want to play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the setup is simple, you (my non-existent reader) can use the colab notebook i pasted below, or to install it on your local, you can follow my already going to be outdated in october 2022 steps that i followed from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/levelsio&#34;&gt;@levelsio&lt;/a&gt; who followed that from someone else:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i just came back from a hut and climbing trip in west switzerland. i have a six year relationship with climbing, and we&amp;rsquo;re pretty comfortable with each other, but in many ways we are still figuring things out. it&amp;rsquo;s hard to overcome my fear of a bad fall, but i do love the challenge of managing that fear. i take it easy, i&amp;rsquo;m not in a rush to be the best. it&amp;rsquo;s something i want to do for a long time. it was partially my decision and knowing what i want out of climbing, and partially coming to terms with the limits of myself and the time i want to devote to climbing vs other things i care about. and i am satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i wanted to rebuild my site, just a little lift to streamline the workflow again. i also was inpsired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://maxammann.org/&#34;&gt;https://maxammann.org/&lt;/a&gt; and the open transparent work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ashleyblewer.com/&#34;&gt;https://ashleyblewer.com/&lt;/a&gt;. previously my site was built with jekyll, then hugo. then i started to dig into nextjs and gatsby. i want to go with a static site generator so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to maintain and has a lot of nice features out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>state vs props in react</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/0007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In React, components are used to translate raw data into rich HTML. Props and state constitute the raw data that gets transformed into HTML using the render() function of a component.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;State belongs to a particular component, is stored within the component, and is used only by the component itself. State can be updated within a component, for instance based on an action (such as user event or network response). By default a component will not have state, so to add an initial state to a component, you can add a class constructor to a class component. The following is an example of using a List Component and constructor method to set the initial state of a count key to a value of 0:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;former title: flatiron school portfolio project 001&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;our cohort is is working on our first portfolio project two months into the flatiron school software engineering part time program. we were asked to create a ruby gem that provides a command line interface to interact with the application that uses an external data source (either by API or web scraping). we were able to use any external data source we wanted, so i made the obvious choice for myself and decided to scrape &lt;a href=&#34;https://mountainproject.com&#34;&gt;mountain project&lt;/a&gt;, a site that describes climbing routes and locations in north america.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i put the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kimpham54/classic_climbs_cli_gem&#34;&gt;classic climbs code repository&lt;/a&gt; up on github with details on how to install and run the application. it&amp;rsquo;s a little object oriented application that scrapes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mountainproject.com/area/classics?type=sport&#34;&gt;classic sport climbs&lt;/a&gt;, prints out a list of those climbs, and the user can then select one of those climbs to get more details about it, scraped from a specific climb&amp;rsquo;s page, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106183204/space-boyz&#34;&gt;space boyz&lt;/a&gt; (point of pride note: i climbed this route in march!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it was a fun exercise to create this application, and it helps that you get to work on content that you enjoy working with. getting to build an object oriented ruby application hardened some of the concepts for me, and helped me think through some of the ways to optimize the program by thinking hard about separation of concerns, improving performance, and trying to be DRY (don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i wanted to note one thing, which makes me think about what it means to work in tech or to be a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the tl;dr: software development is not just about programming and getting your code to work for you, there&amp;rsquo;s many considerations to take into account to say that you have a working application. it&amp;rsquo;s the planning, setting up environment, testing, deployment, security, everything to make your code not only work but continuously operational.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;hello, just introducing myself here on this very website that is my own. i’m currently in the Software Engineering 10-month part-time program &amp;ndash; part-time because i am also working full-time as a librarian! yes I like books, no I do not get to read them for my job. librarians are information professionals, so that means often times our role is to help with the organization and access of information. this can take on many forms, depending on the type of librarian you are. there are subject librarians, such as a science librarian, who might work directly with students and faculty to find the most appropriate resources for their research. there are metadata librarians, who help create, clean, structure, and organize records that are indexed and made searchable in databases. then there are technology librarians (such as myself), who helps to design the software for users to interact with databases/datastores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in my role, i primarily do project management and am a product manager for our digital repository, a custom application to search through our collections of digitized or born digital archival materials, such as scanned photos, audio and video clips, archived websites, documents, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;my own tips to myself, the hopeful learner:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;keep notes. copy and paste sections that are useful, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t ever go back to it (which i actually do), it helps to just go over it again to help with learning the concept. i also keep a list of methods, short code examples that i refer to when i&amp;rsquo;m coding as just a reminder of what&amp;rsquo;s available to use if i can&amp;rsquo;t remember the name or the exact functionality&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;look for other tools to help with learning. i use jupyter notebooks an easier way to manipulate and test code&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;look for other cheatsheets to help with learning. i&amp;rsquo;ve found some good xpath and regex cheatsheets out there that i just do a quick skim of if i have to create a query, cause i find the syntax is really hard to remember offhand&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
