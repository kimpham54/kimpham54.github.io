      <description>i wanted to rebuild my site, just a little lift to streamline the workflow again. i also was inpsired by https://maxammann.org/ and the open transparent work of https://ashleyblewer.com/. previously my site was built with jekyll, then hugo. then i started to dig into nextjs and gatsby. i want to go with a static site generator so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to maintain and has a lot of nice features out of the box.</description>
