i spent a few months learning rust in the end of 2022 for a few half-formed reasons:

- it was always a desire of mine to learn systems programming. i really want to get into some deeper programming, i do love the creative solutions that web development can provide at the frontend/backend level, but i'm also interested in computer science concepts and at least understanding the ideas of building **for** computer science, not just business. scalability, performance, reliability...
- people talk about it a lot on hacker news and in the blockchain space, but also
- linux is supporting rust cool! so i guess it's it's here to stay

so i learned it (https://github.com/kimpham54/rust-book-homework-kim), and i found a deadline too because i was trying to get into the polkadot blockchain academy. i didn't get a chance to take the rust exam. what now? i really enjoyed learning it, so might as well put those amateur skills to use.

to me, contributing to open-source is a beautiful and brutal mechanism to really grow as a person. the transparency, the feedback mechanisms, the self initiative, it's a good chance for self-reflection and really understanding your internal motivations. i don't know of a better way to know what you truly know/don't know about something is to apply your skills in front of an audience - even teaching masks a bit of the truth. it's vulnerable, humbling, empowering. sure i'm waxing poetic a bit but in the past my most rewarding and possible idealized experiences were when I got to work in open source. I do miss being part of that libraryland world - much love to Islandora.

truer to my interests and desire to work more with maps, i reached out to max who's working on maplibre-rs. i've lurked in the community for a bit, but let him know i was interested in a beginner task. so finally when one came up i volunteered. 

i was working on parsing some style specs over the christmas break. took a break, then came back to it in february, which means i forgot everything. henceforth i shall keep notes, and you're welcome to peruse them too.

### maplibre-rs style parser

maplibre-rs has the original maplibre as a module which contains styles. here we're trying to parse an input style in json and deserialize it into a rust object.

- serialize
rust object -> json

- deserialize
json -> rust object

i'm using the serde library to do this. we're creating a Style, Metadata struct in styles. in sources we have a VectorSource struct, in layers
