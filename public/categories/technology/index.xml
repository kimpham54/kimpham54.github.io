      <title>state vs props in react</title>

      <description>In React, components are used to translate raw data into rich HTML. Props and state constitute the raw data that gets transformed into HTML using the render() function of a component.
State belongs to a particular component, is stored within the component, and is used only by the component itself. State can be updated within a component, for instance based on an action (such as user event or network response). By default a component will not have state, so to add an initial state to a component, you can add a class constructor to a class component.</description>

      <description>former title: flatiron school portfolio project 005 + bringing it all together
and&amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap. what a year and a bit it&amp;rsquo;s been. finally, i accomplished something that i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about doing for a long time (about 2 years?), jumped in, managing that with a full time job, life in a new country, precious life things outside of work. i had a hard time juggling everything, but i feel good about finishing the program.</description>

      <description>former title: flatiron school portfolio project 004 + church wafer javascript
i&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my fourth portfolio project for flatiron while doing a west coast tour of the United States. inspired by my friends, ardent lovers of good food made with care and consideration, i decided to make my application about recipes. i find that the flatiron school has a solid, tight curriculum - everything i&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the program so far has built upon each other.</description>

      <description>former title: flatiron school portfolio project 003 + ruby on magic
i completed my first ever ruby on rails project - climbing_gear. that, for me, is a pretty big deal! for a long time i&amp;rsquo;ve used programming languages for scripting, adding simple functionality and building some pretty simple applications where i worked on just the frontend/backend/server. i never worked on each level of an application. so making a full stack rails application is something i&amp;rsquo;m pretty glad i got to finally do.</description>

      <description>former title: flatiron school portfolio project 002 + making reading lists with sinatra
it was a quick turnaround for me to build our second portfolio project, a Sinatra app that uses a whole new slew of ruby web technologies for me, including Rack, Activerecord, Rake, and bcrypt.
in brief, i built an application that behaves like a content management system in that it lets people have their own account to create a list of items to read in the future.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;former title: flatiron school portfolio project 001&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our cohort is is working on our first portfolio project two months into the flatiron school software engineering part time program. we were asked to create a ruby gem that provides a command line interface to interact with the application that uses an external data source (either by API or web scraping). we were able to use any external data source we wanted, so i made the obvious choice for myself and decided to scrape &lt;a href=&#34;https://mountainproject.com&#34;&gt;mountain project&lt;/a&gt;, a site that describes climbing routes and locations in north america.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i put the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kimpham54/classic_climbs_cli_gem&#34;&gt;classic climbs code repository&lt;/a&gt; up on github with details on how to install and run the application. it&amp;rsquo;s a little object oriented application that scrapes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mountainproject.com/area/classics?type=sport&#34;&gt;classic sport climbs&lt;/a&gt;, prints out a list of those climbs, and the user can then select one of those climbs to get more details about it, scraped from a specific climb&amp;rsquo;s page, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106183204/space-boyz&#34;&gt;space boyz&lt;/a&gt; (point of pride note: i climbed this route in march!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was a fun exercise to create this application, and it helps that you get to work on content that you enjoy working with. getting to build an object oriented ruby application hardened some of the concepts for me, and helped me think through some of the ways to optimize the program by thinking hard about separation of concerns, improving performance, and trying to be DRY (don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wanted to note one thing, which makes me think about what it means to work in tech or to be a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the tl;dr: software development is not just about programming and getting your code to work for you, there&amp;rsquo;s many considerations to take into account to say that you have a working application. it&amp;rsquo;s the planning, setting up environment, testing, deployment, security, everything to make your code not only work but continuously operational.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
